*hail, noble seeker, and welcome to the sacred domain of karpurgauram! we, a group of humble fellowship of devotees & volunteers, have embarked upon a most reverent quest—to unveil and immortalize the celestial wisdom of trikaśāsan—kashmir shaivism through the marvels of the digital age.*

*under the ever-illuminating guidance of our eternal, permanent and revered last real direct lineage trika guru, swāmī lakṣamanjū mahārāja, we do labor with heart and soul to weave together the threads of ancient lore and modern ingenuity. our endeavor is not one of mere preservation, but of reawakening—the sacred texts, philosophies, and esoteric truths shall find new voice and visage, that they may touch the hearts of both the learned and the layman in equal measure.*

*through innovative thought and steadfast devotion, we seek to embody and disseminate the ineffable teachings of this divine tradition. let it be known that our efforts are but an offering to the great cosmic dance, wherein all are united in the sublime embrace of universal consciousness.*

*come, kindred spirit, and join us in this most noble enterprise, as we strive to bridge the eternal and the ephemeral, and to rekindle the timeless flame of self-recognization in the hearts of all who yearn for truth.*

*should thou seeketh counsel upon the sacred scriptures of trikaśāsan & the boundless realms of the parābhairava, thou mayest turn thy heart and inquiry toward the author,  Ｎａｇｋｕｍａｒ です at:*

*just like a lamp that banisheth darkness, he doth illuminate the path of wisdom, drawing from the ancient rivers of Indian philosophy, wherein the eternal truths flow as nectar for the thirsty soul.*

*by the grace of the eternal dharma, thou art invited to extend thy thoughts unto him, should thou yearn to unravel the veiled mysteries of existence or to drink deeply of the spiritual nectar that bindeth all things.*
