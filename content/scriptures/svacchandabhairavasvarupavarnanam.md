sanskṛt transcript:—

`त्रिपंचनयनं देवं जटा`
`मुकुट मण्डितम्।`
`चन्द्रकोटि प्रतीकाशं`
`चन्द्रार्ध कृत शेखरम्॥०१॥` 

transliteration:—

`tripaṃcanayanaṃ devaṃ`
`jaṭā mukuṭa maṇḍitam|`
`candrakoṭi pratīkāśaṃ`
`candrārdha kṛta śekharam |01|`

translation:— 

[tri-tin (three), paṃca (five), nayanaṃ (eye) means that each face of the five-faced svachchhanda bhairava has three eyes. the five faces represent consciousness (cit), bliss (ānanda), will (icchā), knowledge (jñāna), and action (kriyā). the three eyes symbolize creation (ṣṛṣṭī), preservation (sṭhiti), and destruction (saṃhāra). the combination of these three actions of creation, preservation, and destruction with the five powers of consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action results in the manifestation of 3 x 5 = 15 eyes.

nayanaṃ means 'upāya' or 'means' or 'method' because of the root 'ni' meaning to obtain. thus, these three actions combined with the five powers symbolize fifteen means.

devā means luminous or the protector of the universe. tt is said: 'devaḥ svatantracid rūpaḥ prakāśātmā maheśvaraḥ' (the deity is an independent consciousness form, the luminous great lord).

jaṭā mukuṭa maṇḍitam – adorned with matted hair and a crown. alternatively, the crown is in the form of matted hair. the innumerable powers such as wealth and others many located above represent the matted hair. the matted hair symbolizes these innumerable powers.

candrakoṭi pratīkāśaṃ – shining like millions of moons. the white light symbolizes the infinity of the sattva guna tattva (quality of purity). it means pure purity, without any impurity, a dense unity of light and bliss.

candrārdha kṛta śekharam – the crescent moon adorning the head, i.e., the main form bearing the crescent moon. the half-moon is the nectar art that pervades the 118 universes and symbolizes the power of consciousness.](<tri-tin (three), paṃca (five), nayanaṃ (eye) means that each face of the five-faced svachchhanda bhairava has three eyes. the five faces represent consciousness (cit), bliss (ānanda), will (icchā), knowledge (jñāna), and action (kriyā). the three eyes symbolize creation (ṣṛṣṭī), preservation (sṭhiti), and destruction (saṃhāra). the combination of these three actions of creation, preservation, and destruction with the five powers of consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action results in the manifestation of 3 x 5 = 15 eyes.

sanskṛt transcript:—

`पञ्चवक्त्रं विशालाक्षं`
`सर्पगोनास मण्डितम्।`
`वृश्चिकैः अग्निवर्णाभैः`
`हारेण तु विराजितम्॥२॥`

transliteration:—

`pañcavaktraṃ viśālākṣaṃ`
`sarpagonāsa maṇḍitam|`
`vṛścikaiḥ agnivarṇābhaiḥ`
`hāreṇa tu virājitam|2|`

translation:—

pañcavaktraṃ - having five faces. these five faces symbolically represent the aspects of śrī bhairava: cit śakti (consciousness power), ānand śakti (bliss power), ìcchā śakti (will power), jñāna śakti (knowledge power), and kriyā śakti (action power).

viśālākṣaṃ – having large eyes – meaning “inward focus, outward vision, devoid of blinking.” this state is implied by viśālākṣaṃ.

sarpagonāsa maṇḍitam – adorned with snakes and venomous creatures called gonas. poisonous snakes symbolize worldly pleasures. gonas symbolize desire. gonas, called viper in english and 'gonas' in kashmiri, is a small, thick, highly venomous and fierce snake species. it's special feature is that even if it is cut into thousands of pieces or uprooted hundreds of times, each part remains pulsating. therefore, 'gonas' is considered a symbol of desire. it is said: even when uprooted or cut into hundreds of pieces, the viper’s parts remain alive; similarly, until the grace of śiva arises, desire remains active and pursues the soul through many births. svachchandnāth has worn this poisonous desire and the disease of desire around his neck.

vṛścikaiḥ – adorned with a garland of red scorpions.

agnivarṇābhaiḥ – scorpions of fiery red color are the most dangerous when they sting. svachchandnāth wears a garland of such red scorpions around his neck. the red scorpion symbolizes the power of attachment, pride, jealousy, and disappearance. when stung by any one of these four, the practitioner becomes disturbed.
