<pre style="text-align: center;">  
still i remain, the same—
after all that has to be
i choose to be aware
in your devotion 
[one pointed]
yet your glamor—
in the form of thoughts
still push me away;
i tell you that i am always—
engaged in offering you—
all that but i fear that
what i have left to offer you—
when whatever there it is,
it is already you, everything—
then why am so insecure?
about what can i offer new! huh,
have i not been devoted to you?
