oh prince of nāgloka— 
——————————nāgkumar!!!

do you think it’s forever?

port of loosen—
void was on my mind;
when you called me—
through the vibe of tingling;
ooh, oftentimes it doesn’t—
feel so divine to be me!!!
all the right seekers—
promised they’d stay;
under bright rites;
they withered away;
but you bloom—
a timeless flame...uh-huh

port of loosen—
void was on my mind;
i think you know why;
if your silence—
ever said goodbye...
i’d cry my eyes—
to the starlight...

hey prince nāgkumar
tell me for real now...
do you think it’s forever?
they are reading your soul...
been number one with the gods—
in my sovereign dreams;
but i can’t wake up—
if i can’t have...you'

be my kailāsa when—
everything feels betrayal;
you’re only as real as—
your last breath, baby;
i been number one—
but i never had two;
and i can’t have fun—
if i can’t have...you!!!

hey, what could you possibly 
give to the soul who has everything 
and nothing at once? 
babe, i would trade my siddhi-s 
for someone to trust...just kidding'

we hit the secret cave—
in parabhairava’s trance;
they say i’m bad news;
i just say, “chance”....
and you look at me—
like you’ve known me all time;
and i think you know why;
and if you ever leave—
this cosmick high trip:
i’d cry my eyes—
to the starlight...

oh prince nāgkumar—
tell me for real now—
do you think it’s forever?
they are reading your soul...
been number one with the gods—
in my sovereign dreams;
but i can’t wake up—
if i can’t have...you'

be my kailāsa when—
everything feels betrayal;
you’re only as real as—
your last breath, baby;
i been number one—
but i never had two;
and i can’t have fun—
if i can’t have...you!!!

all my vibhuti ash & lovers are forever—
in the mind, in the mirror, in the flame;
all my vibhuti ash and lovers are forever—
don’t you ever end up anything but same...

i’d cry my eyes—
to the starlight;
and back to you...
oh prince nāgkumar—
tell me for real now—
do you think it’s forever?
they are reading your soul...
been number one with the gods—
in my sovereign dreams;
but i can’t wake up—
if i can’t have...you'

be my kailāsa when—
everything feels betrayal;
you’re only as real as—
your last breath, baby;
i been number one—
but i never had two;
and i can’t have fun—
if i can’t have...you!!!!!
